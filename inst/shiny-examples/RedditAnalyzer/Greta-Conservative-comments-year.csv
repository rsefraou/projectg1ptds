Ok guys. This is a rant. I think its the only safe place on Reddit where I can express my beliefs. Yes, Im 14. But I am not being moody. Please read this before downvoting it. When I say you note that Im not talking about conservatives, but instead everything they stand against.

Bernie Sanders is a joke. Millennials are a joke. The level of hypocrisy I see on subreddits is mind-boggling. How can you tell me with a straight face that taxing the .1 percent is going to help? My sister is a waitress. Soon, shell be teaching disabled kids in an elementary school. Shes an awesome girl/lady/whatever, and she constantly tells us of her coworkers with no work ethic. They make enough to pay rent, then dont work for the rest of the month. These are the people complaining about college debt being a crisis. THESE are the Bernie voters. THESE are the people that if successful will turn MY country into a third world country. Everything seems peachy on the surface, but their arguments quickly fall apart. How can you possibly tell me that youre facing a crisis and its all a bunch of boomers fault? How can you try to tax Elon Musk? How about this. Go work 3 back to back 90 hour weeks and manage 4+ billion-dollar industries, I dare you. THEN come tell me that taxing hard workers is still a bad idea. 

The short term may seem okay, but for the next generation, FOR ME, youre fucking the world over, just as badly as you claim the boomers are doing to you. Want to see what democratic socialism gets you? Look at Venezuela. Look at the corruption. The tax isnt going to affect the rich and famous. Instead, it will repeatedly screw over the middle and lower classes. The ones trying to start businesses. You complain about how bad high school was, then act like making college FREE wont just extend the reach of our garbage public school system. Making college free will just mean EVERYONE is less educated, and the REAL poor people, the ones that cannot AFFORD to get through high school because they have a little sister and their own two-year-old to take care of? Theyll just get poorer. Because when the big businesses you despise so much are looking to hire and they see that you had to drop out of high school and that you didnt even go to college when its FREE? They wont hire you. Teenage jobs will cease to exist, and burger-flipping will go to the machines. When my generation is complaining about not being able to get a job until theyre 23, guess who itll be on? Guess whos fault itll be. Not the boomers. The millennials. The ones that preach equality and then turn around to blame an ENTIRE generation for issues that have been manifesting themselves for over a century. So when people ask me which democrat I think is the most dangerous (which admittedly Ive never been asked btw), I dont say Warren (shes pretty bad). I dont say Yang. I dont say O Rourke or whatever his name is, although hes just as awful. I say Bernie and his one-track thinking followers.

The short term may seem okay, but for the next generation, FOR ME, youre fucking the world over, just as badly as you claim the boomers are doing to you. Want to see what democratic socialism gets you? Look at Venezuela. Look at the corruption. The tax isnt going to affect the rich and famous. Instead, it will repeatedly screw over the middle and lower classes. The ones trying to start businesses. You complain about how bad high school was, then act like making college FREE wont just extend the reach of our garbage public school system. Making college free will just mean EVERYONE is less educated, and the REAL poor people, the ones that cannot AFFORD to get through high school because they have a little sister and their own two-year-old to take care of? Theyll just get poorer. Because when the big businesses you despise so much are looking to hire and they see that you had to drop out of high school and that you didnt even go to college when its FREE? They wont hire you. Teenage jobs will cease to exist, and burger-flipping will go to the machines. When my generation is complaining about not being able to get a job until theyre 23, guess who itll be on? Guess whos fault itll be. Not the boomers. The millennials. The ones that preach equality and then turn around to blame an ENTIRE generation for issues that have been manifesting themselves for over a century. So when people ask me which democrat I think is the most dangerous (which admittedly Ive never been asked btw), I dont say Warren (shes pretty bad). I dont say Yang. I dont say O Rourke or whatever his name is, although hes just as awful. I say Bernie and his one-track thinking followers.

Ok guys. This is a rant. I think its the only safe place on Reddit where I can express my beliefs. Yes, Im 14. But I am not being moody. Please read this before downvoting it. When I say you note that Im not talking about conservatives, but instead everything they stand against.

Bernie Sanders is a joke. Millennials are a joke. The level of hypocrisy I see on subreddits is mind-boggling. How can you tell me with a straight face that taxing the .1 percent is going to help?

But this whole Greta Thunberg has skyrocketed me to be a trump supporter. I mean look at the fucking media... it is so absolutely fucking biased that I want to pull my hair out. Oh so its okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? 

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules. 

____________________________________________

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

I never wanted to declare allegiance with a political party because I see flaws with both sides. 

But this whole Greta Thunberg has skyrocketed me to be a trump supporter. I mean look at the fucking media... it is so absolutely fucking biased that I want to pull my hair out. Oh so its okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? 

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much?

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

I never wanted to declare allegiance with a political party because I see flaws with both sides. 

But this whole Greta Thunberg has skyrocketed me to be a trump supporter. I mean look at the fucking media... it is so absolutely fucking biased that I want to pull my hair out. Oh so its okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? 

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much?

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded.

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother).

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

I never wanted to declare allegiance with a political party because I see flaws with both sides. 

But this whole Greta Thunberg has skyrocketed me to be a trump supporter. I mean look at the fucking media... it is so absolutely fucking biased that I want to pull my hair out.

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much?

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

____________________________________________

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

But this whole Greta Thunberg has skyrocketed me to be a trump supporter. I mean look at the fucking media... it is so absolutely fucking biased that I want to pull my hair out. Oh so its okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? 

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules. 

____________________________________________

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

____________________________________________

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

____________________________________________

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

Ive had it with the news, Ive had it with Instagram, Ive had it with reddit.

I never wanted to declare allegiance with a political party because I see flaws with both sides. 

But this whole Greta Thunberg has skyrocketed me to be a trump supporter. I mean look at the fucking media... it is so absolutely fucking biased that I want to pull my hair out. Oh so its okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? 

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules. 

____________________________________________

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

____________________________________________

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

Ive had it with the news, Ive had it with Instagram, Ive had it with reddit.

I never wanted to declare allegiance with a political party because I see flaws with both sides. 

But this whole Greta Thunberg has skyrocketed me to be a trump supporter. I mean look at the fucking media... it is so absolutely fucking biased that I want to pull my hair out. Oh so its okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? 

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

____________________________________________

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother).

That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time:

- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded.

And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much?

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

____________________________________________

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

Oh so its okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? 

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much?

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

____________________________________________

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

I never wanted to declare allegiance with a political party because I see flaws with both sides. 

But this whole Greta Thunberg has skyrocketed me to be a trump supporter. I mean look at the fucking media... it is so absolutely fucking biased that I want to pull my hair out. Oh so its okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? 

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much?

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

____________________________________________

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

Oh so its okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? 

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much?

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

____________________________________________

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

Ive had it with the news, Ive had it with Instagram, Ive had it with reddit.

I never wanted to declare allegiance with a political party because I see flaws with both sides. 

But this whole Greta Thunberg has skyrocketed me to be a trump supporter. I mean look at the fucking media... it is so absolutely fucking biased that I want to pull my hair out. Oh so its okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? 

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

____________________________________________

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time:

- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother).

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time:

- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules. 

____________________________________________

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

____________________________________________

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

____________________________________________

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

Oh so its okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? 

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

____________________________________________

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

____________________________________________

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

But this whole Greta Thunberg has skyrocketed me to be a trump supporter. I mean look at the fucking media... it is so absolutely fucking biased that I want to pull my hair out.

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much?

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother).

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded.

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much?

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much?

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

____________________________________________

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules. 

____________________________________________

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

____________________________________________

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

____________________________________________

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

Ive had it with the news, Ive had it with Instagram, Ive had it with reddit.

I never wanted to declare allegiance with a political party because I see flaws with both sides. 

But this whole Greta Thunberg has skyrocketed me to be a trump supporter. I mean look at the fucking media... it is so absolutely fucking biased that I want to pull my hair out. Oh so its okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? 

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules. 

____________________________________________

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

____________________________________________

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

Ive had it with the news, Ive had it with Instagram, Ive had it with reddit.

I never wanted to declare allegiance with a political party because I see flaws with both sides. 

But this whole Greta Thunberg has skyrocketed me to be a trump supporter. I mean look at the fucking media... it is so absolutely fucking biased that I want to pull my hair out. Oh so its okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? 

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

____________________________________________

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much? 

____________________________________________

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

____________________________________________

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

Ive had it with the news, Ive had it with Instagram, Ive had it with reddit.

I never wanted to declare allegiance with a political party because I see flaws with both sides. 

But this whole Greta Thunberg has skyrocketed me to be a trump supporter. I mean look at the fucking media... it is so absolutely fucking biased that I want to pull my hair out. Oh so its okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? 

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!

And are we going to ignore the fact that sex trafficking profits immensely from an open border? Same thing with drug trafficking? 

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much?

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded.

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much?

Ive seen the videos of children taken away from their parents but in every single statement Ive read, the children are only taken away if the person they are with is not part of their nuclear family (AKA mother, father, sister, brother). That is to prevent sex trafficking. The videos are twisted to make it seem like this is all Trumps fault. Can one man fuck up this country so much?

All I see everywhere is how bad Trump is. And you know what some points I agree with, he is kind of an idiot on twitter, and also some extreme conservatives are blatantly racists and homophobic. But for the most part it is strait up Trump bashing over every little detail. 


I remember a post on reddit not too long ago talking about how Trump didnt remember the differences between two different bible versus, but I saw the interview and it was purposely misleading. And yet some people in the comments section were talking about how they were true Christians and yet they hated Trump. 

That is the most hypocritical thing I have ever read. If you are a true Christian you love the sinner and hate the sin. At least, thats how I was raised. You dont judge someone or put yourself above someone else because you think youre a better Christian than the other person. THATS THE REASON WHY MOST PEOPLE LEAVE RELIGION!

So what is Trump this week? Is he a white supremest? He is racist? Is he a traitor? Is he a Russian spy? Is he homophobic? Is he a rapist? Is he taking away womens rights? Is he inciting hate speech? Is he a nazi? 

Those are all words simple minded people can wrap their heads around.

Ive had it with the news, Ive had it with Instagram, Ive had it with reddit.

I never wanted to declare allegiance with a political party because I see flaws with both sides. 

But this whole Greta Thunberg has skyrocketed me to be a trump supporter. I mean look at the fucking media... it is so absolutely fucking biased that I want to pull my hair out. Oh so its okay for democrats to make fun of a 16 year old male with a MAGA hat who was PROVEN TO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG but yet the democrats demonizes everyone who does the same with Greta? 

What the fuck!

And other thing that pissed me off. I live in El Paso, the second most crossing of illegal immigrants. Heres a situation I see all the time: 

- illegal crosses the border and buys a cheap car with no insurance.
- gets into a car wreck with someone who has insurance
- the person with insurance gets fucked because the illegal immigrant cannot pay for the damages and it comes all out of the other persons pocket

And every time I talk about this subject online I get compared to a nazi saying Vare Are Yor Paperz!!!! How is that even comparable? I care for people and I want everyone to be here, but it creates problems for everyone when people dont follow the rules.

I also hate how the holding facilities here are compared to concentration camps. Yes the conditions are shitty, but they arent getting funded. And Im not going to lie, I dont know who is supposed to be funding them. But I know for sure that democrats will complain about it instead of going out there and supporting those in need. 

I would feel it to be justifiable for the democrats to complain about it if they were the ones solely providing for the needy, but yet they arent!
